Use the EnergyAware Profiler (eAProfiler) application to measure the power consumption of both the baseline and improved solutions.
You can export eAProfiler data as a .csv file which can be imported into your report, as exemplified in Figure \ref{fig:PowerCons}.
Show how the power consumption changes when your solution is responding to different events in different states (or usage scenarios) with plots, and comment on your findings.
How does the energy efficiency of the improved solution compare to the baseline?
